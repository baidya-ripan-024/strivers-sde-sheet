## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

**Example1**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/29/vtree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
```

**Example2**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/29/vtree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
          1 is at the top, so it comes first.
          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.
Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
```

**Example3**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/29/vtree3.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.
Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.
```

## [Expected Approach] Using BFS , O(n log n) time and O(n) space

### Code
```java
class Tuple{
    int vlevel; // vertical level
    int level; // level
    TreeNode node;

    public Tuple(int vlevel, int level, TreeNode node){
        this.vlevel = vlevel;
        this.level = level;
        this.node = node;
    }
}
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> verticalTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>(); // result
        if(root == null) return ans;

        Queue<Tuple> q = new LinkedList<>(); // Tuple : {verticalLevel, level, node}

        // Map to store vertical level -> {level -> {value, value, ....}}
        // Key is vertical level and value is another TreeMap in which key is the level and value 
        // is Priority Queue, which will store values in ascending order if multiple values are in the same level of the vertical level
        // We use a TreeMap to store key & value because the key will be sorted in ascending order
        TreeMap<Integer, TreeMap<Integer, PriorityQueue<Integer>>> mp = new TreeMap<>();

        // when move left, vertical level is decreased by 1, when move right, vertical level is increased by 1
        // when move down, level is increased by 1
        // considering 0 based level
        q.offer(new Tuple(0, 0, root)); 

        while(!q.isEmpty()){ 
            int length = q.size();

            for(int i = 0; i < length; i ++){
                Tuple current = q.poll();

                TreeNode curNode = current.node;
                int curVLevel = current.vlevel; // Current vertical level
                int curLevel = current.level; // Current level

                if(curNode.left != null) q.offer(new Tuple(curNode.left, curVLevel - 1, curLevel + 1)); 
                if(curNode.right != null) q.offer(new Tuple(curNode.right, curVLevel + 1, curLevel + 1)); 

                // If the current vertical level is not yet in the map, add it and initialize a new TreeMap for levels
                if (!mp.containsKey(curVLevel)) {
                    mp.put(curVLevel, new TreeMap<>());
                }

                // If the current level (depth) is not yet present for this vertical level, 
                // add it and initialize a new min-heap (PriorityQueue) to store node values in ascending order
                if (!mp.get(curVLevel).containsKey(curLevel)) {
                    mp.get(curVLevel).put(curLevel, new PriorityQueue<>());
                }

                // Add the current node's value to the corresponding min-heap
                mp.get(curVLevel).get(curLevel).offer(curNode.val);

            }
        }
        
        // Iterate over the vertical levels and add the node values to the result list
        for(TreeMap<Integer, PriorityQueue<Integer>> v : mp.values()){
            ans.add(new ArrayList<>());

            for(PriorityQueue<Integer> el : v.values()){
                while(!el.isEmpty()){
                    ans.get(ans.size()-1).add(el.poll());
                }
            }    
        }
        return ans; 
    }
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`**

    1. **Traversal (`while` loop over all nodes)** : visit each node exactly once, This gives: **`O(n)`**
    2. **Insertion into TreeMap** : At each node, you're inserting into this nested structure:
       ```java
       TreeMap<Integer, TreeMap<Integer, PriorityQueue<Integer>>>
       ```
       * Inserting into a `TreeMap` (by vertical and level) takes: **`O(log v)`**, where `v` is the number of vertical levels or depth levels (at most `n`).

       * Inserting into a `PriorityQueue`: **`O(log k)`**, where `k` is the number of elements at that vertical+level. In worst case, could be `O(log n)`.
    
       * So **per node**, map + heap insert = **`O(log n)`**, Across `n` nodes → **`O(n log n)`**

    3. **Building the Result (Final `for` loop):**
        * traverse the entire `TreeMap` and extract all values from the heaps.
        * Extracting each value from a PriorityQueue (min-heap) is `O(log k)`, but since total elements are `n`, and each `.poll()` is called once, the total cost of all `.poll()` is:
  
**`O(n log k)`**, where `k` is the average size of heaps (in worst case `O(n)` but usually small).

- So, the overall time complexity is **`O(n log n)`** in the worst case.


2. **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**
    1. **Queue for BFS:** At most holds `O(n)` nodes in the worst case → **`O(n)`**
    2. **TreeMap + Nested TreeMap + PriorityQueue:**
        - Each node is stored **once** in the nested map structure.
        - Total number of entries = `n`
        - So space used by maps + heaps = **`O(n)`**
    3. **Result List** : You store all node values in the final answer list → **`O(n)`**
