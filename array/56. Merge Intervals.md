## Description
Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
``` 

### Constraints
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4`


## [Expected Approach] Checking Last Merged Interval â€“ O(n*log(n)) Time and O(n) Space

### Intuition
To merge overlapping intervals, we can:
1. **Sort the intervals** based on their start times.
2. Iterate through the sorted intervals and merge them if they overlap.

### Approach
1. **Sort the Intervals**:
   - Sort the intervals in ascending order based on their start times.
2. **Merge Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Use a list to store the merged intervals.
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals:
     - If the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the list, add it to the list.
     - If it overlaps, merge it with the last interval in the list by updating the end time of the last interval.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        // Sort the intervals based on their start times
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        ArrayList<int[]> out = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            if (out.isEmpty() || interval[0] > out.get(out.size() - 1)[1]) {
                // If no overlap, add the current interval to the list
                out.add(interval);
            } else {
                // If there is an overlap, merge the intervals
                int[] prevInterval = out.get(out.size() - 1);
                prevInterval[1] = Math.max(prevInterval[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }

        // convert ArrayList<int[]> to int[][]
        return out.toArray(new int[out.size()][]);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`  
  - Sorting the intervals takes `O(n log n)` time.
  - Iterating through the intervals takes `O(n)` time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`  
  - The space used to store the merged intervals in the `ArrayList`.


## Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```python
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

### Step 1: Sort Intervals
After sorting, the intervals become:
```python
[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

### Step 2: Merge Intervals
- Start with an empty list: `out = []`
- Add `[1,3]` to `out`: `out = [[1,3]]`
- Merge `[2,6]` with `[1,3]`: `out = [[1,6]]`
- Add `[8,10]` to `out`: `out = [[1,6],[8,10]]`
- Add `[15,18]` to `out`: `out = [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

### Output:
```python
[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```
